# Anchor
Anchor is my 2025 Swift Student Challenge submission. It helps people through a panic attack or migraine using the psychiatric principle of dropping anchor and incorporating information from trusted sources such as the Mayo Clinic.

## Technologies
I used a lot of technologies to make Anchor possible. **SwiftUI** was the primary framework as the building block for the UI. But with that, I also used **AVFoundation**, **CoreHaptics**, and **MediaPlayer** for the direct UX. This was presented in the music, sfx, and haptic feedback to button clicking. For the mantra repetition in Panic Attack Relief, I used **Speech** to translate the audio to text for code interpretation with Regex. Similarly, **PencilKit** was used for the sketching canvas feature in both relief sectors. **Combine** was used in the background for the moving mesh gradients to animate them moving in random positioning, making my life programming significantly easier. Finally, **SwiftData** was responsible for the persistance of Medication Logging.

## Demo
Here is my super rushed demo ðŸ˜….

> I am sorry there isn't any SFX, the audio didn't capture and I added the music in post.
